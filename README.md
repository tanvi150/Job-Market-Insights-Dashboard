# Job Market Insights Dashboard

## Project Overview

The **Job Market Insights Dashboard** is a data analysis project aimed at understanding trends in job demand, hiring patterns, and popular skills in 2023–2024. The project uses real-world LinkedIn job postings data and a complementary Kaggle dataset to provide actionable insights for job seekers, recruiters, and analysts.

## Objective

- Analyze trends in job demand across industries and roles.

- Identify hiring patterns and high-demand skills.

- Compare datasets to validate findings and simulate webscraping using Kaggle data.

## Datasets

1. LinkedIn Job Postings (2023–2024)

- Originally provided by the Data Analytics Club EXCOs

- Cleaned and processed to extract relevant features such as job title, company, location, and skills.

2. [Kaggle Jobs & Skills (2024)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/1-3m-linkedin-jobs-and-skills-2024)

- Retrieved to simulate webscraping for comparison purposes.

- Cleaned and analyzed similarly to LinkedIn data.

## Methodology
- Data Cleaning & Processing:
   - Handled missing values, standardized columns, and formatted data for analysis.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

   - Libraries used: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `squarify`

   - Visualized trends in job demand, skill requirements, and hiring patterns.

- Comparative Analysis:
   - Compared LinkedIn and Kaggle datasets to identify consistent trends and anomalies.
 
## Key Findings
- Top industries and roles with highest hiring activity.

- Most sought-after skills in 2023–2024.

- Regional and temporal patterns in job postings.

- Differences and similarities between real-world (LinkedIn) and simulated (Kaggle) datasets.

   - You can use Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook or any other environements you're comfortable using.
3. Upload the datasets:
   - In Google Colab, use the upload feature to add the CSV files.
   - If using another environment, ensure the CSVs are in the same directory as the notebooks.
4. Run the code:
   - Execute the cells step by step to see data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.
   - Explore the EDA and comparative analysis for insights into job trends and skills demand.
